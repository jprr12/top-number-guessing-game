# top-number-guessing-game
This simple number guessing game is a personal project based off of the Odin Project. Player first picks a difficulty. Easy level gives the player unlimited guesses between 1-100, hard level gives the player 15 guesses between 1-1000, and insane level gives the player only 10 guesses between 1-1000.
